jekyll-lunr-advanced-js-search is a gem that creates a prebuilt lunr index for a Jekyll site and also provides users with a prebuilt JavaScript plugin for creating and displaying a search. This quickstart guide provides step by step instructions for installing this gem. 

If you don't want to build using the gem and just use the JavaScript plugin the code for the plugin and css are located here. If the plugin is not used the settings will have to be set in a page manually. An example of this can be seen in this page: [https://github.com/dnoneill/annotate/blob/master/js/index.js](https://github.com/dnoneill/annotate/blob/master/js/index.js). Widgets are only used in the Ruby plugin.
