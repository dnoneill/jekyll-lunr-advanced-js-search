# jekyll-advancedsearch
This repository provides a framework for creating an advanced search in Jekyll using lunrjs. It prebuilds the lunr index and will render the search page based on settings in the config.yml file.

It is based on this work: https://github.com/slashdotdash/jekyll-lunr-js-search

It allows more customization through the config file and will not only build the index but create the search interface.
